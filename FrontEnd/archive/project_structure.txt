# BetterSave Energy Dashboard - Project Structure

The code has been restructured into the following modular components for easier maintenance:

## File Structure

```
bettersave_dashboard/
├── main.py                 # Main application entry point
├── imports_config.py       # Imports and global configuration
├── data_loader.py          # Data loading and processing functions
├── styling.py              # CSS styling and UI component functions
├── analysis.py             # Data analysis and calculation functions
├── visualization.py        # Plotly visualization functions
└── components.py           # UI component rendering functions
```

## Module Overview

### main.py
The main entry point for the Streamlit application. It imports all other modules and orchestrates the app flow.

### imports_config.py
Contains all imports needed for the application and basic configuration settings.

### data_loader.py
Functions for loading and processing data from CSV files, including filtering and preprocessing.

### styling.py
Contains the Webflow-inspired CSS theme and UI component rendering functions for consistent styling.

### analysis.py
Data analysis functions for calculating metrics, trends, forecasts, and anomaly detection.

### visualization.py
Plotly chart creation functions for different visualization types with consistent styling.

### components.py
Functions for rendering different sections of the dashboard UI, organized by tab/section.

## Usage

To run the application:

1. Place all files in the same directory
2. Make sure the CSV data files are in the parent directory as expected by the app
3. Run the application using:

```
streamlit run main.py
```

## Customization

- To modify styling: Edit the CSS in `styling.py`
- To change data analysis: Modify functions in `analysis.py`
- To update visualizations: Edit chart creation in `visualization.py`
- To change UI components: Update rendering in `components.py`
- To modify app structure: Edit main flow in `main.py`

This modular structure makes it much easier to maintain and extend the dashboard.
